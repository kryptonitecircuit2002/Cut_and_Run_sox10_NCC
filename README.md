CUT&RUN Analysis of Histone Variant and Chromatin State Dynamics During Neural Crest Development

This repository contains the computational workflows and downstream analysis scripts used to process and analyze CUT&RUN datasets generated from zebrafish neural crest cells across development. The analyses were performed to investigate the genomic occupancy and developmental dynamics of the histone variants H2A.Z and H3.3 and their relationship with chromatin states defined by H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K27me3.

Raw sequencing data were processed using the nf-core/CUT&RUN Nextflow pipeline. Downstream analyses include peak annotation, chromatin-state classification, histone variant occupancy dynamics, variant–chromatin state integration, motif enrichment, gene ontology analysis, and data visualization.
